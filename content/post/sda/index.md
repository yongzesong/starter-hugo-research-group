The Second-Dimension Spatial Association (SDA) examines spatial association by extracting more information about the geographical environment outside sampling locations.

Geospatial data contains essential information on geographical characteristics, but current spatial prediction models are limited in extracting diverse geographical information outside sample locations. 

The Second-Dimension Spatial Association (SDA) improves prediction accuracy compared with Random Forest Kriging, one of the best-performed spatial machine learning models. SDA models provide smooth, effective, and low-uncertainty spatial predictions.
